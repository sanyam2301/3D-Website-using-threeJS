# Creating an AI-Powered 3D Product Website with Three.js

## Description

In today's digital landscape, 3D graphics have become a powerful tool for showcasing products, and artificial intelligence (AI) adds a whole new dimension to the user experience. In this project, we embark on a journey to build a cutting-edge 3D product website using the popular Three.js library and infuse it with the capabilities of artificial intelligence.

- The project begins with an exploration of Three.js, a JavaScript library that simplifies 3D graphics rendering in web browsers.
- We delve into the fundamentals of 3D modeling, including creating 3D models of products and scenes.
- Key concepts such as meshes, materials, and lighting are covered to bring your product visuals to life.
- We create an interactive and visually appealing interface where users can explore products in 3D space
- Users can customize colors, textures, and configurations of products within the 3D environment.
